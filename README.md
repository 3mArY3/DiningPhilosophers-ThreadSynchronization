# Dining Philosophers - Thread Synchronization in Python

This project is an implementation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem using Python. The solution demonstrates effective thread synchronization and resource management, focusing on avoiding deadlocks and ensuring all philosophers get their meals. The project is designed to showcase skills in concurrent programming and managing shared resources in a multithreaded environment.

## Key Features:
- **Thread Synchronization:** Uses Python threading and locking mechanisms to simulate philosophers picking up and releasing forks.
- **Deadlock Avoidance:** Implements logic to ensure no deadlock conditions occur.
- **Real-Time Status Display:** Outputs the current status of philosophers in real-time, including whether they are eating, thinking, or waiting for forks.
- **Adjustable Parameters:** Easily modify the number of philosophers and meals to experiment with different scenarios.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script using Python.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to observe the philosophers' behavior.

## Future Improvements:
- Implementation of additional algorithms for deadlock prevention.
- Adding a GUI for better visualization of the philosophers' actions.
